operator:
  ###
  # The number of Operator pods to deploy.
  # Higher values increase availability in the event of worker node failures.
  #
  # The cluster must have sufficient number of available worker nodes to fulfill the request.
  # Operator pods deploy with pod anti-affinity by default, preventing Kubernetes from scheduling multiple pods onto a single Worker node.
  replicaCount: 1
  ###
  #
  # The `Requests or Limits <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/>`__ for resources to associate to Operator pods.
  #
  # These settings can control the minimum and maximum resources requested for each pod.
  # If no worker nodes can meet the specified requests, the Operator may fail to deploy.
